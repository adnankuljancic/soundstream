# Soundstream

SoundStream is a Spotify like web application which is a online music straming platform through which users can access a library of songs and playlists from various genres and artists.
We decided to develop it because we think its a good project to sharpen our coding skills by using differrent architectural and desing patterns.

This release marks the beginning of our journey as we showcase the initial set of features and functionalities.

With a functional frontend featuring basic routing, home, login, mysongs, and register pages, users can now experience access to a library of their songs.

The login and register functionalities provide a secure way for users to create accounts.

Additionally, the ability to add and remove songs adds a dynamic element to the application.

As this is a major release, we are excited to continue building upon these foundations, enhance the user experience, and introduce new features in future releases.
